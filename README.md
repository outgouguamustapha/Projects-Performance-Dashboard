## Executive Summary

This comprehensive Power BI dashboard provides real-time insights into project management performance across a portfolio of 53 projects and 163 tasks. The dashboard monitors critical metrics including budget utilization (83.4%), task completion rates (75.0%), and financial performance with total costs of $8,733K against a budget of $10,469K. The solution delivers actionable insights across four key dimensions: executive KPIs, cost analysis, project timelines, and manager performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for stakeholders at all levels of the organization.

## Business Problem

Organizations managing multiple concurrent projects face significant challenges in maintaining visibility and control over:

- **Budget Overruns**: 22 out of 53 projects (42%) are currently over budget, with the highest overrun at 105.1% for the Skylink Metro project
- **Schedule Delays**: 16 projects (30%) are overdue, with the Urban Trade Hub project delayed by 154 days
- **Resource Allocation**: Uneven workload distribution across 8 project managers, with some managers handling 7 pending tasks while maintaining only 61.4% completion rates
- **Performance Visibility**: Lack of real-time insights into project status, cost trends, and team performance across 6 different project types (Infrastructure, Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Renovation, Institutional)
- **Geographic Distribution**: Inability to track performance across multiple locations and identify regional bottlenecks

Without centralized monitoring and analytics, leadership teams struggle to identify at-risk projects, optimize resource allocation, and prevent budget overruns before they escalate.

## Methodology

### Data Collection & Preparation
- **Data Source**: Consolidated project management dataset containing 53 projects with 163 associated tasks
- **Data Scope**: Projects spanning from February 2025 to September 2026
- **Key Dimensions**: Project type, location, manager assignment, priority levels, status, and financial metrics

### Dashboard Development Process
1. **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between projects, tasks, budgets, and resource assignments in Power BI Desktop
2. **KPI Definition**: Identified and calculated critical metrics including budget utilization, completion rates, and variance analysis
3. **Visualization Design**: Created four specialized dashboard pages:
   - **Executive Summary Dashboard**: Real-time KPIs, status distribution, and priority categorization
   - **Cost Analysis**: Monthly trends, budget vs. actual comparisons, and over-budget identification
   - **Project Timeline**: Interactive Gantt charts with task-level tracking and status indicators
   - **Project Manager Performance**: Individual manager metrics, workload distribution, and completion rates
4. **Interactive Features**: Implemented filters, slicers, and drill-through capabilities for dynamic analysis
5. **Deployment**: Published to Power BI Service for organization-wide access and automated refresh scheduling

### Analytical Approach
- Comparative analysis of budget utilization across project types
- Trend analysis of monthly costs vs. budgets
- Geographic mapping of task completion rates
- Performance benchmarking across project managers
- Priority-based risk assessment

## Results & Business Recommendation

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Portfolio Health**: 53 active projects with $10.5M total budget
- **Financial Performance**: $8.7M actual costs with 83.4% budget utilization
- **Delivery Status**: 75% task completion rate with 44% of projects completed
- **Budget Management**: $1.7M remaining budget across active projects

### Critical Findings

**High-Risk Projects Requiring Immediate Attention**:
- **P037 - Skylink Metro**: 105.1% budget utilization ($342K cost) - requires immediate cost control measures
- **P017 - Urban Trade Hub**: 154 days overdue - needs schedule recovery plan or scope reassessment

**Project Type Performance**:
- Infrastructure projects show highest budget utilization (87.5%), indicating either efficient resource use or potential underbudgeting
- Institutional projects demonstrate best budget management (79.3%), providing a benchmark for other categories
- 22 projects flagged as over-budget across all categories

**Manager Performance Insights**:
- Hakima Amrani requires workload balancing or additional support (7 pending tasks, 61.4% completion)
- Opportunity to redistribute tasks from overloaded managers to optimize team capacity

### Business Impact
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Real-time monitoring enables proactive intervention on at-risk projects
- **Cost Savings**: Early identification of budget overruns prevents further financial escalation
- **Resource Optimization**: Workload insights enable better task distribution and team efficiency
- **Improved Decision-Making**: Data-driven insights support strategic planning and resource allocation
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Transparent reporting builds trust with executives and clients

## Recommendation

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
1. **Address Critical Projects**:
   - Conduct immediate cost review for Skylink Metro (P037) to prevent further budget escalation
   - Initiate recovery plan for Urban Trade Hub (P017) or negotiate timeline extension with stakeholders
   
2. **Rebalance Workloads**:
   - Redistribute 3-4 tasks from Hakima Amrani to managers with lower pending task counts
   - Establish maximum task limits per manager to prevent future bottlenecks

3. **Budget Control Measures**:
   - Implement weekly budget reviews for the 22 over-budget projects
   - Establish approval gates for additional spending requests

### Short-Term Improvements (1-3 months)
1. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Add automated alerts for projects approaching 90% budget utilization
   - Create weekly digest reports for executives highlighting at-risk projects
   
2. **Process Optimization**:
   - Standardize project budgeting methodology based on Institutional project success rates
   - Develop project type-specific templates incorporating lessons learned

3. **Training & Support**:
   - Conduct dashboard training sessions for all project managers
   - Create user guides for self-service reporting

### Long-Term Strategic Initiatives (3-12 months)
